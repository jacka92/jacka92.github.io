  <p>Proventor is built on the MEAN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js. GPS statistics of various physiological measures are gathered, compiled and housed in the MongoDB database. These measures are visualised alongside injury incidences in order to allow coaches and professional staff to assess the relationships and correlations between these measures and incidences of injury. The application uses a Node.js server, with the native Node driver handling requests to the MongoDB database. An Angular.js SPA has been developed for the front end, with highcharts.js rendering statistics on graphs. </p>
  <p>Some preliminary Machine learning work was also applied to test data sets. This was achieved through use of the scikit-learn Python library. Supervised classification algorithms were examined, for instance, Gaussian Naive-Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and K-Nearest-Neighbour. Though the plot below is only on test data, it establishes the methods through which these classification methods might in future be used to detect players at high risk of intrinsic injury during training sessions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, given that this software is proprietary I am unable to publicise code, however, an out of the box MEAN stack application is available <a href="http://github.com/jacka92/MEAN"> here</a></p>
